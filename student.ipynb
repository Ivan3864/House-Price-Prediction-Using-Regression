    "## Project Title: House Sales Analysis in King County\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Defining the Question\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a) Specifying the Data Analytic Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Analytic Question:** How can we provide advice to homeowners in King County about how home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes and by what amount?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) Defining the Metric for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the success of our analysis, we will consider the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Performance:** We will assess the overall performance of our regression models using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared (R^2) value. The lower the MSE or RMSE and the higher the R^2 value, the better the model's predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regression Model Coefficients:** We aim to identify at least two regression model coefficients that are statistically significant and have a meaningful impact on the estimated value of homes. These coefficients will help us provide specific recommendations to homeowners regarding the potential value increase associated with certain home renovations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Recording the Experimental Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The experimental design for this analysis will involve the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection:** We will use the King County House Sales dataset, specifically the `kc_house_data.csv` file, which contains information about house sales in King County. The dataset includes various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, condition, and other relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning and Exploration:** We will perform data cleaning tasks, handle missing values, and explore the dataset to gain a better understanding of the variables and their relationships. This will involve visualizations, summary statistics, and correlation analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection:** Based on our domain knowledge and exploratory analysis, we will select relevant features that are likely to impact the estimated value of homes. We will consider factors such as location, size, condition, and other characteristics that influence home prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Building:** We will build multiple linear regression models using different combinations of features and techniques. We will start with a basic model and iteratively refine it by adding or removing features, transforming variables, or using regularization techniques as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Evaluation and Selection:** We will evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as MSE, RMSE, or R^2. Based on the results, we will select the best-performing model that provides accurate predictions and meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Interpretation and Recommendations:** Once we have the final model, we will interpret the regression coefficients and provide recommendations to homeowners about how specific home renovations can potentially increase the estimated value of their homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Exploring the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the King County House Sales dataset to get familiar with its structure and content:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `id`: Unique identifier for a house\n",
    "- `date`: Date house was sold\n",
    "- `price`: Sale price (prediction target)\n",
    "- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms\n",
    "- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms\n",
    "- `sqft_living`: Square footage of living space in the home\n",
    "- `sqft_lot`: Square footage of the lot\n",
    "- `floors`: Number of floors (levels) in the house\n",
    "- `waterfront`: Whether the house is on a waterfront\n",
    "- `view`: Quality of view from the house\n",
    "- `condition`: Overall condition of the house\n",
    "- `grade`: Overall grade of the house\n",
    "- `sqft_above`: Square footage of the house apart from the basement\n",
    "- `sqft_basement`: Square footage of the basement\n",
    "- `yr_built`: Year when the house was built\n",
    "- `yr_renovated`: Year when the house was renovated\n",
    "- `zipcode`: ZIP Code used by the United States Postal Service\n",
    "- `lat`: Latitude coordinate\n",
    "- `long`: Longitude coordinate\n",
    "- `sqft_living15`: The square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors\n",
    "- `sqft_lot15`: The square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that some features, such as `date`, `view`, `sqft_above`, `sqft_basement`, `yr_renovated`, `zipcode`, `lat`, `long`, `sqft_living15`, and `sqft_lot15`, may not be used in the analysis based on your project requirements. We will focus on the relevant features to answer our data analytic question.\n",
